### **Project Explanation**

The **Git MR Diff Viewer** is a tool designed to simplify the process of reviewing code changes in GitHub Pull Requests (PRs) and GitLab Merge Requests (MRs). It provides a user-friendly interface for developers to view and analyze code diffs, along with AI-powered feedback to improve the quality of code reviews.

The project consists of two main components:
1. **Backend (Node.js)**: Fetches the diff data from GitHub or GitLab using their respective APIs. It also integrates with the Mistral AI API to generate intelligent code reviews.
2. **Frontend (React.js)**: Displays the fetched diff data in a clean, interactive UI, allowing developers to compare changes side-by-side. It also renders AI-generated feedback in Markdown format.
